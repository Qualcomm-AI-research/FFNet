## Paths and instructions to download the model weights
The included script fetch_pre_trained_weights.sh will download and uncompress pre-trained model weights.
In addition to pre-trained supervised ImageNet model weights (meant for further downstream training), and Cityscapes segmentation training weights, for some of the models we also make ImageNet Self Supervised Training weights available. These weights are trained using [PixPro](https://github.com/zdaxie/PixPro).
